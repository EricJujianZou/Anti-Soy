# Anti-Soy

**Stop wasting founder time on resumes. Find real engineers in minutes, not hours.**

## The Problem You're Facing

As an early-stage startup founder, you know the pain:

- **Your time is too valuable** to spend hours reviewing GitHub profiles and resumes
- **Can't afford a dedicated HR team** to properly vet technical candidates
- **Resumes lie** - candidates misrepresent skills, lean too heavily on AI-generated code
- **Coding tests don't reflect reality** - they test algorithms, not production engineering
- **You need to know**: Can they actually ship? Do they write maintainable code? Or is it all AI vibe-coded?

Most founders spend **30 seconds glancing at a GitHub profile**, then rely on "tell me about your project" in interviews because they haven't actually reviewed the code. You know you should dig deeper, but who has the time?

## Our Solution

**Anti-Soy analyzes GitHub profiles in 3 minutes and tells you what would take you hours to discover.**

### How It Works

**Input**: GitHub username  
**Output**: Comprehensive candidate analysis dashboard

### What You Get

✅ **Code Quality Evaluation** - Architecture decisions, error handling, security practices  
✅ **AI Detection Score** - % of AI-generated code vs. genuine engineering  
✅ **Documentation & Comments** - Do they write maintainable code?  
✅ **Real Project Analysis** - Does their code actually do something, or just look pretty?  
✅ **Dependency Management** - Are they pulling in 500 packages for a todo app?  
✅ **Open Source Contributions** - Community recognition, merged PRs  
✅ **Technical Agility** - How many languages/frameworks have they mastered? (>500 LOC projects)  
✅ **Interview Hints** - Smart questions to ask based on their code patterns

| **Coding Assessments** (HackerRank, LeetCode) | Tests algorithms, not real-world engineering                     | Analyzes actual shipped projects                          |
| **Resume Screeners**                          | Keyword matching, easily fooled                                  | Inspects actual code quality and practices                |
