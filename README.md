# Anti-Soy

Startups are struggling to find good candidates and good candidates don't hear about startups.

# The problem

It is very difficult for companies to find **competent** technical people who know their stuff.

- many people overly misrepresent their skills on their resume
- too reliant on AI and will only every be as smart as Claude
- dont have a large online presence / are unknown

# Traditional solutions

- Extensive interviewing and research by HR/senior devs
- Headhunting on social media
- Interviewing

# Our Solution

- look on candidate github
  - scan the repos
    - look for architecture decisions, why did you pick this level of abstraction for your api/app?
    - security
    - error handling (do you only handle the happy path? what about edge cases)
    - vibe coded?
    - how many dependencies do you have?
    - Scalable?
    - stars
    - comments in code?
    - does your project actually do something?
  - look for open source contributions
    - part of which online communities?
    - how many prs get merged
  - technological agility
    - how many languages / frameworks are you competant in (projects >500 lines of code)

Provide a dashboard to analyze candidates. Give interviewers hints as to what to ask about to know candidate deeper.
