 - Simple frontend -> Lovable
 - Simple backend, dummy data for now -> FastAPI
 - insane scraper -> browser-use?
 - Social Engineering Search -> Social prescence (look for articles, tweets, OSS contributions etc. for online credibility)
 - How are we unique from SkillsSync (https://www.skillsync.wiki/), GitHired (https://www.githired.tech/)
 	- We are special in a way, where we allow startups to look for employees with fine technical skills as well. So they need to go through LinkedIn pages etc.
	- For instance YC Companies (LiveKit shared this problem with us)
