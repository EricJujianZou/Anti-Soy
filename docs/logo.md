# Logo Ideas for Anti-Soy

This document outlines several concepts for the Anti-Soy logo. The goal is to find a balance between a professional, trustworthy image for B2B sales and a memorable, slightly edgy brand that reflects the "Anti-Soy" name.

### Concept 1: The Code Filter

*   **Core Idea:** Visually represent the process of filtering out "bad" code to find the "good" code.
*   **Visuals:**
    *   A stylized funnel or filter icon.
    *   Above the funnel: messy, tangled lines, perhaps resembling spaghetti or a jumble of random characters `(#<*/>?)`.
    *   Below the funnel: clean, parallel lines, or a simple, elegant shape like `< >` or `{}`.
*   **Vibe:** Technical, effective, clean, precise.
*   **Color Palette:** Professional tech colors. Blues, greens, dark grays, with a contrasting accent color.

### Concept 2: Signal vs. Noise

*   **Core Idea:** Anti-Soy helps you find the "signal" (a good engineer) in the "noise" (bad resumes, messy GitHub profiles).
*   **Visuals:**
    *   A waveform graphic. A chaotic, noisy wave on the left transforms into a clean, strong sine wave on the right.
    *   Alternatively, a magnifying glass icon focusing on a clean line of code (`=>`) within a background of jumbled, messy code.
*   **Vibe:** Analytical, insightful, intelligent.
*   **Color Palette:** Dark mode friendly. A dark charcoal or navy background with a bright, high-contrast color for the "signal" (e.g., electric blue, neon green, or orange).

### Concept 3: The "No Soy" Stamp

*   **Core Idea:** A direct, bold, and slightly humorous take on the name.
*   **Visuals:**
    *   A stylized soy bean pod or a single soy bean.
    *   A "prohibition" symbol (a red circle with a diagonal slash) overlaid on top of the bean.
    *   To make it more professional, the design could be minimalist and abstract, almost like a stamp of approval (or disapproval).
*   **Vibe:** Confident, bold, memorable, a little bit cheeky.
*   **Color Palette:** Strong, primary colors. Red for the prohibition symbol is a must. Black, white, and red would be a powerful combination.

### Concept 4: The Target/Bullseye

*   **Core Idea:** Anti-Soy helps you target and hire the right engineer with precision.
*   **Visuals:**
    *   A target or crosshair icon.
    *   The center of the bullseye is not a dot, but a stylized pair of code brackets `{}` or a simple checkmark `✓`.
*   **Vibe:** Decisive, accurate, goal-oriented, efficient.
*   **Color Palette:** Monochromatic (black and white) or using a single accent color like red or blue to highlight the center.

### Concept 5: The Polished Gem

*   **Core Idea:** Finding a great engineer is like finding a diamond in the rough.
*   **Visuals:**
    *   An icon showing the transition from a rough, uncut stone into a polished, multi-faceted gem (like a diamond).
    *   This could be a two-part icon or a single icon that cleverly incorporates both states.
*   **Vibe:** Premium, value-oriented, aspirational. Suggests quality and finding hidden talent.
*   **Color Palette:** Grays and blues for the "rough" part, with a bright, sparkling white or cyan for the "polished" gem.
